# Met Office Archive Listing

The MetOfficeArchiveDocuments.xlsx spreadsheet lists documents in the Met Office's Online Archive at https://digital.nmla.metoffice.gov.uk/. The online archive contains thousands of documents 
in an extensive hierarchy; it can be hard to get a feel for the range and volume of content when browsing using its web page interface, hence this spreadsheet.

The spreadsheet focuses on documents relating to old observations, including publications containing observations, and so only covers a subset of the top level collections in the archive:
* Archive Treasures
* Historic Weather Events
* UK Observation Data and Reports
* Met Office General Met Publications [which includes Meteorological Magazine]
* Met Office Corporate Publications [which includes Met Office Annual Reports]
* Met Office Science
* Met Office Technical Met Publications
* Met Office Open Access Repository
* International Meteorological Organisations
* Climate Analysis and Reports


Each row in the spreadsheet relates to a particular archive document. Fields in the spreadsheet are:

* **Met Office ID** : the identifier used for the document by the Met Office web site. Append the ID to https://digital.nmla.metoffice.gov.uk/ to get a URL for accessing the document, e.g. https://digital.nmla.metoffice.gov.uk/IO_8c2bfcab-284e-4078-b1a0-7a672a3ccfb0
* **Collection** : which top-level Met Office Collection the document sits under, e.g. 'UK Observation Data & Reports'
* **Path** : shows the combined hierarchy levels which take you to the document - e.g. 'Land Observations  >  Stations Of The Second Order  >  Stations of Second Order 1881-1890'
* **Document Label** : is the text at the bottom of the hierarchy which provides the link to the document - e.g. '1886' 

* **Document Type** : derived field, to identify what type of document this is, for the common types, e.g. 'Climatological Return' or 'Daily Weather Report'
* **Country**, **County**, and **Location**: derived fields for documents which relate to a particular location. The 'County' field is used flexibly, so is not always a county name, especially where the country is 'Rest of World'.

* **Hierarchy Position** and **Level** : give a summary indication of where the document lives in the overall hierarchy. Useful for sorting.
* **Archive ref no** : Met Office classification scheme: see https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/library-and-archive/archive/collections

Data for the spreadsheet was extracted in mid April 2024. It contains a column to indicate which entries are new since the previous extract, in February 2024.
